üîç DEBUGGING BLOOD REQUEST API NOTIFICATIONS

Since you received SMS from the test script, the notification system works.
The issue is that notifications aren't being sent when creating requests through the UI.

üìã NEXT STEPS TO DEBUG:

1. üñ•Ô∏è  CHECK SERVER CONSOLE:
   - Look at your Next.js server terminal (where you ran 'npm run dev')
   - Create a blood request through the UI
   - Look for these log messages:
     ‚úÖ "Blood request created: [REQUEST_ID]"
     ‚úÖ "Found X compatible donors out of Y total donors"
     ‚úÖ "üì¢ Sending notifications to eligible donors..."
     ‚úÖ "Compatible donors: [DONOR_LIST]"
     ‚úÖ "SMS result for [PHONE]: [RESULT]"

2. üö® IF YOU DON'T SEE THESE LOGS:
   The blood request creation is failing before reaching the notification code.
   Common causes:
   - Authentication errors
   - Validation errors
   - Database connection issues
   - Missing required fields

3. üîß IF YOU SEE SOME BUT NOT ALL LOGS:
   There's an error in the notification processing code.
   Look for error messages in the server console.

4. üì± IF YOU SEE ALL LOGS BUT NO SMS:
   There might be an issue with the SMS API calls within the notification batch processing.

IMMEDIATE ACTION:
1. Keep your server terminal visible
2. Create a blood request through the UI (testeur requesting A+ blood)
3. Watch for the log messages above
4. Copy any error messages you see

The notification system itself is working perfectly - we just need to find why
the UI requests aren't triggering the notification code.
